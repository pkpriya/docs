.. _aggregate-introduction:

`ODK Aggregate` provides a ready-to-deploy server and data repository to:

- provide blank forms to ODK Collect (or other OpenRosa clients).
- accept finalized forms (submissions) from ODK Collect and manage collected data.
- visualize the collected data using maps and simple graphs.
- export data (e.g., as CSV files for spreadsheets, or as KML files for Google Earth).
- publish data to external systems (e.g., Google Spreadsheets or Google Fusion Tables).
