msgid "Encrypted forms provide a mechanism to keep your data private even when using **http:** for communications (e.g., when you do not have an **SSL certificate** or **https:** is not available). Encrypted forms may also enable Google App Engine deployments (and deployments using other web database services, e.g., AWS) to comply with data privacy laws, eliminating the necessity for setting up your own servers to meet those requirements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../encrypted-forms.rst:24
msgid "Encrypted forms apply asymmetric public key encryption at the time the form is finalized within ODK Collect. This encrypted form can then be submitted up to ODK Aggregate and downloaded to ODK Briefcase. ODK Briefcase, when supplied with the asymmetric private key (which ODK Briefcase never stores), can then decrypt and export the form data as a CSV file for your use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../encrypted-forms.rst:26
msgid "This process ensures that the finalized form's data (and media attachments) are encrypted before being submitted to ODK Aggregate, remain encrypted while stored on ODK Aggregate, and remain encrypted as the data and attachments are pulled into ODK Briefcase, where they are again stored in encrypted form."
msgstr ""

#: ../../encrypted-forms.rst:30
msgid "ODK Aggregate cannot meaningfully publish encrypted forms to Google Spreadsheets or Fusion Tables since the encryption obscures the entire contents of the form and ODK Aggregate never possesses the asymmetric key required to decrypt the form."
msgstr ""

#: ../../encrypted-forms.rst:31
msgid "When using encrypted forms, ODK Aggregate serves only as a data aggregation point — you must download, decrypt, and export the data using ODK Briefcase to access the unencrypted data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../encrypted-forms.rst:33
msgid "The non-encrypted data is available on the ODK Collect device during data collection and whenever a form is saved without marking it as complete. Once you mark a form as complete (finalize it), ODK Collect will generate a random 256-bit symmetric key, encrypt the form contents and all attachments with this key, then construct a submission manifest which describes the encrypted submission and an asymmetric-key encryption of the symmetric key used for the encryption. This manifest is the \"form\" that is uploaded to ODK Aggregate, with the encrypted form contents and its encrypted attachments appearing as attachments to this submission manifest \"form.\""

msgid "Security Concerns"
msgstr ""

#: ../../encrypted-forms.rst:55
msgid "While ODK Collect attempts to remove all unencrypted copies of a finalized form and its attachments from the device, because ODK Collect uses third-party applications for image capture, etc., and because of the potential for Forced Close events during the clean-up process, we cannot guarantee that all copies will have been destroyed. Furthermore, because of the way an SD card writes and deletes information, there is a possibility of this data being recoverable from the free space on the SD card. Your organization should investigate the extra steps needed to ensure all data is deleted from the SD cards on your ODK Collect devices and should establish procedures to periodically wipe and reinstall those devices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../encrypted-forms.rst:59
msgid "Encrypting a form ensures that the finalized form is not readable and is not tampered with. However, there is nothing preventing a malicious adversary from the wholesale replacement of a finalized form with falsified data or the synthesis and submission of extra data — these are not contingencies that encrypted forms seek to address."

The action attribute should be the url to which the submission should be posted; this is the ODK Aggregate website url with Aggregate.html replaced by submission. Finally, what identifies the form as an encrypted form is the presence of a *base64RsaPublicKey* attribute.
