msgid "Turn on data encryption"
msgstr ""

#: ../../collect-security.rst:22
msgid "Turning on Android-level data encryption means when the device is locked, no one can see the data. Unlocking your encrypted device decrypts your data. Encryption can add protection in case your device is stolen. It's an easier alternative to using encrypted forms that offer most of the benefits."
msgstr ""

#: ../../collect-security.rst:26
msgid "Encryption takes an hour or more to complete. Before you start, ensure that battery is charged and keep the device plugged in until encryption is complete. Make sure your data is backed up, just in case something goes wrong."
msgstr ""

#: ../../collect-security.rst:30
msgid "Interrupting encryption process may lead to loss of some or all of your data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../collect-security.rst:31
msgid "The process is irreversible. The device cannot be decrypted once the encryption is setup and you will have to wipe out all the data for decryption or removing encryption."

msgid "Encryption cannot be performed until you have setup either a PIN or a password lock. Pattern lock is not allowed with encryption."
msgstr ""

#: ../../collect-security.rst:65
msgid "Setting a strong passcode is imperative to protect your Android phone. The longer the passcode (or alphanumeric password), the tougher it will be for an attacker to gain access to your device. Even a lock screen won't necessarily prevent a thief or hacker from getting access to your data. You can use apps that destroy all the data after few failed attempts to unlock the device.

msgstr ""

msgid "If you are using SD card for storage, you can encrypt that too by choosing :guilabel:`Encrypt SD card` in the :guilabel:`Encryption` section. This not only encrypts the contents of the SD card, but it also means that the card cannot be used on another device unless it is wiped."
msgstr ""

#: ../../collect-security.rst:95
msgid "You should also ensure that device debugging (via adb) is disabled when collecting data, as that can enable users to pull data from the device after it has been successfully booted (when the sdcard encryption key is entered). i.e., if the debugging interface is enabled, someone could steal the device, connect it to a laptop, and pull data off it as long as it has not been shut down as they don't need to successfully unlock the device's lock screen to gain access."

msgid "Though storing your data in the cloud is good for backing it up, law enforcement can demand that Google turn over your data. The best way to keep your Android phone from sending your personal data to its servers is to turn off backup. The downside is if you lose your phone, you may lose your data.
