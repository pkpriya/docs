msgid "If a server will filter the set of forms based upon the user's identity, then the server should require that the user be authenticated through either the :doc:`openrosa-authentication` or through an alternative authentication mechanism. The server can then make use of the user's authenticated identity through those mechanisms to filter the set of forms to be returned."
