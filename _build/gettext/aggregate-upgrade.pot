Since most users have just a simple short alphanumeric id for their forms, the fix is to change from using xmlns to using id to define your \"form id\". E.g., use *id=\"myformid\"* instead.

This is a concern because Aggregate can filter results based on the values of individual columns. The ranking order for the string \"111\" would place it before (less than) \"13\", but that would be incorrect if this field were actually an integer value.
