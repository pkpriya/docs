msgid "Data Security Considerations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:39
msgid "Any communication over HTTP (vs. HTTPS) can be observed by others and is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks (where a malicious intermediary inserts itself between the client and the server the client intended to contact). As a consequence, if communication is over HTTP, clients may be submitting their form data to a malicious intermediary. That intermediary will see the full contents of the form submission. Additionally, the intermediary may never forward the submission to the intended server --- the client can never be certain that the submitted data has been recorded on the intended server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:41
msgid "HTTPS requires that the server be configured with an SSL certificate issued by a signing authority. Man-in-the-middle attacks are possible over HTTPS if clients do not authenticate the server's SSL certificate (or, less commonly, if the client device or signing authority has been compromised)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:43
msgid "OpenRosa compliant client devices MUST authenticate server certificates when establishing HTTPS channels to those servers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:45
msgid "Because client communications are often through unsecured hotspots, it is recommended that HTTPS (with the authentication of server certificates) be used for all communications."

msgid "Typical Interaction"
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:50
msgid "A typical transaction consists of the following steps."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:52
msgid "The client asks for a resource that requires authentication but does not provide a user name and password. Typically this is because the user simply entered the address or followed a link to the page."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:54
msgid "The server responds with the 401 response code, either requesting Digest Authentication and providing the authentication realm and a randomly-generated, single-use value called a nonce, or requesting Basic Authentication (in which case the server should also redirect and negotiate TLS channel security (https) if the client is not already communicating over https)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:56
msgid "At this point, the client will present the authentication realm (typically a description of the computer or system being accessed) to the user and prompt for a user name and password. The user may decide to cancel at this point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:58
msgid "Once a user name and password have been supplied, the client re-sends the same request but adds an authentication header that includes the response code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:60
msgid "Assuming the username and password are valid,  the server accepts the authentication and the page is returned. If the user name is invalid and/or the password is incorrect, the server might return the `401` response code and the client would prompt the user again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:63
msgid "A client may already have the required user name and password without needing to prompt the user; for example, if they have previously been stored by a client."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:65
msgid "For Basic Authentication, the \"response\" value is simply a base-64 compression of the user name concatenated with \":\" and the plain-text password, as specified in RFC2617."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:69
msgid "Anyone with a network sniffer could read this value, decompress it, and obtain the user name and password. Hence, it is critical that this information only be transmitted over HTTPS or some other secure transport."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:71
msgid "Even with HTTPS, sending this is not a highly secure practice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:73
msgid "For Digest Authentication, the \"response\" value is calculated in three steps, as follows. Where values are combined, they are delimited by colon symbols."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:75
msgid "The MD5 hash of the combined user name, authentication realm and password is calculated. The result is referred to as HA1."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:76
msgid "The MD5 hash of the combined method and digest URI is calculated, e.g. of \"GET\" and \"/dir/index.html\". The result is referred to as HA2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:77
msgid "The MD5 hash of the combined HA1 result, server nonce (nonce), request counter (nc), client nonce (cnonce), quality of protection code (qop) and HA2 result is calculated. The result, the user name and the cnonce are the \"response\" value provided by the client."
msgstr ""

#: ../../openrosa-authentication.rst:79
msgid "The Digest Authentication response value is thus sent in such a way that an adversary can extract the user name from the response, but cannot extract the password from the response. It can therefore be sent over an unsecured channel (for example, HTTP )."
