#: ../../briefcase-api.rst:249
msgid "``formid`` may be a URL (since it might be an xmlns), so when parsing this query parameter, it is safest to find the last instance of ``@version`` and split the string at that location. In any case, it is your string to parse and interpret for your server configuration."
