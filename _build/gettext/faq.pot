Therefore, to support multiple languages you need to `specify the question text in the appropriate language using the tag <https://opendatakit.org/about/research/>`_. To change the language the XForm's questions are being rendered in, simply click the 'Menu' button on the Android while filling out a form and click the 'Change Language' button."

Collect determines its user interface language (not question language) based on the phone's overall settings. For example, in the phone settings, if you set the phone's locale to Espanol, Collect will render its navigation text in Spanish."
