"The exception is when several issues are closely related or can "
"reasonably be worked on together.  In this case, it should be clear by "
"looking at the conversation on the Github issues that the items are "
"related and will be worked on together. Your PR message should also make "
"it clear which issues are being worked on, and whether the PR closes the "
"issues or not. Mention the PR by number:"
