"Much of OpenRosa communication comes in the form of HTTP requests and "
"responses. In order to properly maintain appropriate formatting and "
"compatibility over time, it is ideal for some information to be "
"consistently provided on both sides of these interactions."

"When a response is issued from an OpenRosa server, the format of the "
"response payload will often be defined by the specific API (Form List, "
"for instance). However, APIs which are fundamentally transactional (user "
"registration, form submission, etc) all contain similar semantics. As "
"such, they will utilize a shared XML Envelope of the format:"

"APIs using this response can then include their namespaced payload inside"
" of the response. This response should be handled by the client the same "
"way, regardless of the specific submission. That is, any time an OpenRosa"
" response envelope is received, any of its payloads should be parsed "
"properly."

"The message component of a response envelope should be returned (if "

"The ``nature`` attribute of a message is an optional ID which can be used"
" to categorize the type of a response. If the ``nature`` of two messages "
"is identical in a bulk operation, for instance, the assumption is that "
"only one of them need be presented to a user (presumably the newest)."
