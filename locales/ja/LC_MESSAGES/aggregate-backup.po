"Finally, restore it from MySQL dump. An SQL dump of a database is a "
"common method to safely store away a snapshot of the database for "
"archival purposes or to migrate data between database instances, e.g. "
"between two major system releases. The content of a SQL dump is a large "
"collection of SQL commands in ASCII. Running the script will recreate the"
" database in the same state as it was when the dump was created. The "
"primary tool to consider for making an ASCII dump is `mysqldump "
"<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-backup-excerpt/5.7/en/using-"
"mysqldump.html>`_, which includes a wide variety of options."
